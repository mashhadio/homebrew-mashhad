  # verify the sha256 against a URL that never changes under it. The filename carries no
  # version — the tag in the path already pins it — but it must keep #{arch}: both macOS
  # builds land in the same release and a bare Mashhad.dmg would collide. Renamed as of
  # 1.0.5; do not point this at 1.0.2 or earlier, whose assets are Mashhad-<version>-<arch>.dmg.

  # The bundle inside the .dmg is "Mashhad.app" (electron-builder falls back to
  # `executableName` for the bundle filename because productName is non-ASCII).
  # Its CFBundleName is still "مشهد", which is what Finder and the menu bar show.
  # This must be the on-disk filename or Homebrew fails with "App source ... is not there".

  # The build is ad-hoc signed under its own identifier (com.abdul.mashhad) but NOT
  # notarized — notarization needs a paid Developer ID. macOS therefore still
  # quarantines a downloaded .dmg, so strip the attribute on install to launch cleanly.
  #
  # As of 1.0.8 the identifier is ours. Before that the bundle carried stock Electron's
  # ad-hoc signature (Identifier=Electron), sharing one CDHash with every unsigned
  # Electron build; Apple revoked that hash and Gatekeeper blocked Mashhad outright with
  # "contains malware" — which this block could not help with, because revocation is
  # enforced separately from quarantine. Keep the identifier unique.
  #
  # Remove this block only once the app is properly signed + notarized.
